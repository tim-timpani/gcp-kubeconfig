# GCP KUBECONFIG Using Python API
This is a demo of how to generate kubeconfig YAML using the GCP
python API library.  It has little value in its current form
but just to run and verify the module is working.  The intent
is to provide a module that can be placed in a larger automation
workflow where the Kubernetes config is needed as YAML or a dict.
